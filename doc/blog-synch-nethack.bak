[ This is a post to the TAEB Blog (http://taeb-blog.sartak.org) describing
  the challenge of deciding when the interactive program 'NetHack' is done
  sending output.  It covers many of the issues involved in
  IO::Pty::HalfDuplex and so is kept here for documentation purposes. ]

This is the second in a series of articles about TAEB's current
implementation.

One of the nastiest problems TAEB has to solve is also one of the
most mundane.  If you've ever played a game over a network or on
a heavily loaded computer, you are probably familiar with lag and
the problems it creates.  While NetHack, as a turn-based game,
does not suffer from directly lag-caused _deaths_, it is still
very difficult to make moves sensibly when the responces are
delayed.

Bots like TAEB also suffer from lag, indeed much worse than people
do.  Twenty milliseconds is quite unnoticable for a human but is
an eternity for a bot, and even at that timescale issues of finding
the end of a turn are normal.  Furthermore, bots are much less able
to recover from partial updates than people are, due to the lack of
sensible error-recovery.

[ insert a half-redrawn NetHack screenshot here; will probably have
  to image-edit it ]

Look at the image above.  Presumably, the player just exited a
full-screen menu or changed dungeon level.  A full screen redraw for
NetHack is larger than the MTU of most networks, and due to lag, the
second packet has been delayed significantly.  (This doesn't require
weird conditions; TCP normally waits until data has been successfully
received before sending more.)  As a result, the lower half of the
current frame is black.  TAEB, on seeing this frame, makes a couple of
damaging inferences:

1. The lower half of the level has turned into stone.  This is an
   especially nasty case if the redraw was caused by stairs, as
   TAEB interprets large areas of new stone to indicate a brand new
   unexplored level, corrupting the dungeon graph.

2. The bottom line is all spaces and unparsable, resulting in error
   spam and no stats.

Clearly, bots need a reliable way to tell when NetHack is done
sending output for the turn.  There have been several approaches to
this problem over the years.

== Consistently slow ==

One of the oldest and simplest approaches is simply to sleep for
one second or so after every move, to wait for NetHack.  This works,
most of the time.  It has two major flaws; first it is very slow,
second it is unreliable - if lag spikes above 1 second, the bot
may see an incomplete frame.  Nevertheless, it is very simple to
implement and has been used in several efforts.

== Avoiding the issue ==

Another approach which has been historically used, most famously
by the Angband Borg, is to link the bot into the game's input
routines.  In theory, this is foolproof, but it carries dangers
of a different sort, in addition to the obvious restriction to
local games.

If done incautiously, the linking can affect game mechanics or
leak information, thus compromising the validity of the bot
effort.  Modifying the game requires a very in-depth knowledge of
NetHack's implementation, which is very unclean and non-transparent
in places.  Furthermore, requiring the bot to be linked into
NetHack greatly complicates the build process; the bot cannot be
built or distributed as a self-contained object unless all of
NetHack is duplicated, prohibitive effort for many starting
projects.   As such, the linking approach is very rarely used.

== Inline pings ==

One approach which is often proposed, but sadly does not work, is
the inline ping.  Simply send an invalid command after every
real command, and wait for the error.  Unfortunately, there is no
command which is invalid in every context in NetHack.

== Telnet ping/pong ==

Invented for NetHack fairly early on, and the most common method in
use today, this relies on a side channel.  A bot connects to a
telnet server using a raw TCP socket, and implements the protocol
itself; after every command is sent, the bot attempts to negotiate
an invalid telnet stream option (DO 99).

When a telnet daemon receives the packet containing the command, it
sees an option it does not support and responds in failure (WONT 99),
then passes the command off to NetHack.  Shortly afterward, NetHack's
response is responded to the bot.  Thus, the bot receives NetHack's
response very shortly after the "pong".  In effect, the telnet options
are used as a side channel to dynamically measure network lag.  Since
under normal conditions network lag is the dominant component of
total lag, this gives the bot a very good idea of when the output
should be expected.

The reliability of this approach is improved by kernel packet
coalescing.  When the pong is sent, the network implementation at
the server waits a short time to potentially send a larger packet;
if packet sending is low-priority, this will additionally tend to
be delayed until NetHack is done calculating.  With the pong and
the response generally in the same packet, they are guaranteed to
arrive at the bot at exactly the same time.

While good enough for bots, this approach is not quite foolproof.
If NetHack takes a long time to reply to a command, due to system
load, slow execution (there are several quadratic algorithms in
the game), or simply being swapped out, it is possible for the
kernel to time out the attempt to coalesce, and the pong will
arrive significantly before the output.  This has been the source
of several unreproducable errors in TAEB, and is generally
annoying, but not quite enough to motivate one of the harder
solutions.

This approach is also limited to telnet servers.  It does not
help at all with lag as it occurs on heavily-loaded local systems,
and does not work well with other network protocols.  In principle
SSH could be used, however the vastly higher complexity of the SSH
protocol makes a custom implementation prohibitively difficult.

== Expectations and Confusion ==

Horne-Bummel's /bridey/ works on an entirely different principle
from the other bots.  Instead of relying on out-of-band data to
find complete frames, bridey is more like a human in that it waits
for a frame that looks complete.  The code which generates actions
also provides a predicate for a sensible-looking result; fully
filled bottom line, cursor on the character, etc.  bridey has a long
and a short timeout; it waits for data over the short timeout, then
continues if it sees a sensible frame.  To guard against programming
errors, bridey will continue with a nonsensical frame after the long
timeout expires.

Actually, bridey combines this with other mechanisms above; the short
timeout is 1 telnet ping/pong cycle, and the long timeout is 4, thus
hopefully increasing reliability further.  bridey, like TAEB, uses
simple sleeps on the local interface.

== Abusing POSIX Job Control for Fun and Profit ==

In 2008 a novel method appeared, which is currently being adopted by
TAEB for the local interface.  NetHack is single threaded and makes
very little use of asynchronous calls, so when it is blocked on tty
input it cannot possibly generate output until more keys arrive.  So,
if we could somehow find out when NetHack blocks, we would solve the
synchronization problem permanently - unlike the methods above, this
is immune to system load.

On the surface, finding out when a process blocks would seem to
require low-level, privileged, and generally highly nonportable code.
However, we are not the first user of the information.  It is
possible in UNIX to move processes between the foreground and
background at will; if it were possible for background processes to
read keyboard input, chaos would result.  The traditional solution
is for the kernel to stop any process when it attempts to read in
the background.  Stops, like deaths, result in wait() events; this
is necessary in order that the shell may continue them.

With this insight, the solution seems fairly obvious - simply put
NetHack in the background, then when it stops, let it read.  There
are a few complications in this, though.  First, it's not possible
to simply shovel data into a stopped reader; it has to be briefly
continued in the foreground.  How long is briefly?  Depends on...
system load.  Fortunately, there is a trick we can use to make this
not affect accuracy - check for data on the virtual keyboard,
with ourselves in the foreground.  If we see anything, the slave
needs to read more, and we re-continue it, using exponential
backoff.  Of course, data typed is not always immediately available
due to line-buffering and various forms of special-key processing -
but that applies to us too, so we still get the right answer.

Even with that settled, POSIX only allows a process to use job
control if it lives inside the simulated terminal.  That means, we
need to fork a slave in order to do the actual manipulation, and
communicate using pipes.

This is a very unusual thing to be doing with the terminal driver,
and it has exposed two bugs in the BSD kernel so far.  First, in
all known versions of BSD, a process which reads in the background
does not actually receive the stop signal until it returns to user
mode; but it returns to user mode only once the wait for terminal
data completes!  In regular usage, this is masked, because when
you type "bg" all waiting threads are woken, but it was a killer
for us; the eventual workaround I found was to briefly change the
terminal blocking mode, thus forcing the kernel to reconsider all
active blocks.  Finding this bug, and the workaround for it, took
an annoyingly long amount of time.

Another bug the project found was that the BSD kernel does a
one-second sleep whenever a process that already is in the background
tries to read.  The reasons for this are quite unclear, but it
has the effect of killing performance of this approach.  Fortunately,
recent versions of Darwin (OS 10.5.7 is known to work) have a
rewritten sleep system, and this call is no more.

A comparability minor issue was found in Linux; attempting to read
from an idle psuedoterminal master fails with a No such device error,
instead of the EOF return that would be expected of devices with
pipe semantics.  I'm not sure if this is a bug, but it did require
workaround code.

== Variations on the theme ==

Job control abuse works pretty well on Linux and Darwin, but what if
you're on something else?  Well, there's always low-level, privileged,
and generally non-portable code.  As seems to often be the case with
hacks like this, it usually takes the form of a debugger API abuse;
set breakpoints on the functions that can read from the terminal, and
arrange to capture output somehow.  These approaches share a common
liability; debugger interfaces are highly security-sensitive and are
often in some way disabled.

* On most UNIXes (including the BSDs) there is a system call 'ptrace'
  which fits the bill perfectly.  Unfortunately, while the style
  of ptrace is virtually identical everywhere, no two UNIXes implement
  the call in exactly the same way.  'ptrace' implements security by
  refusing to trace processes of other users and denying user and
  group changes while active; this is a real bother for us, as NetHack
  is normally installed to change group to one that can access the
  saves and scoreboard.

* Windows has a debugger interface which is well documented and
  consistent across versions.  Nice?  Well, Windows also has, last
  time I counted, 30 different documented ways to read from the console.
  Writing the correct traps to catch them all would be interesting, to
  say the least.

* Ironically, the best chances seem to exist on DOS.  Programs are
  debugged by directly hooking the operating system, allowing for
  a fully consistant interface, and there are very few paths for
  keyboard reading.  Unfortunately, CPAN on DOS is non-functional,
  and installing any large Perl system without it is extremely
  tedious.

* Departing from the trend of debuggers, it is also possible on the
  BSDs to simply poll the process status fairly effeciently.  This
  is probably worse than the ptrace method, but has the advantage of
  working across security contexts.

== Conclusion ==

In the field of bot writing, even the simplest things can prove almost
insurmountably complex, and this is very evident in dealing with lag,
both network and loading.  Lag-related problems are a major cause of
unreproducable faults in even the most sophisticated NetHack bots.
Many of the simplest approaches to controlling lag are deeply flawed
and will make debugging difficult.  Let this be a lesson to everyone
who wants to start from scratch.
